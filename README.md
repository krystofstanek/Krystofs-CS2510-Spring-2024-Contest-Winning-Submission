My contest-winning submission from Northeastern University's CS2510 during Spring 2024, specifically "CS 2510 'Fundamentals of Computer Science 2' Oakland". 
Out of a class of approximately 200 students, my submission completed in an impressive 0.32 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than the rest of the competition-40x faster than second place, 350x faster than 3rd place. My submission was then shared with the class by the professor to further the learning of other students.

For this contest, our class was tasked with creating a simple image-processing program implementing seam-carving. 
The leaderboard for this contest was ranked according to how quickly our program was able to complete a set of pre-defined actions.
A common approach within the class was to utilize a 'pixelgrid' which would be updated according to instructed changes, and then the images would
be updated from that.

My breakthrough came from my realization that I could entirely bypass the 'pixelgrid' and directly implement my changes on
the image itself. This alongside other advanced improvements, such as predetermining the order of blue columns to be removed, as the blue value of a
column never changed, allowed me to achieve a decisive first place competition.

Aside from just securing a win in this contest and the other contest that was held during this semester, these contests allowed for me to display my problem-solving ability as I was given opportunities to experiment with innovative solutions.
