For this contest our class was tasked with creating a simple image-processing program implementing seam-carving. 
The leaderboard for this contest was ranked according to how quickly our program was able to complete a set of pre-defined actions.
A common approach within the class was to utizlie a 'pixelgrid' which would be updated according to instructed changes, and then the images would
be updated from that. My breakthrough came from my realization that I could entirely bypass the 'pixelgrid' and directly implement my changes on
the image itself. This alongside other advanced improvements, such as predetermining the order of blue columns to be removed ( as the blue value of a
column never changed ) allowed me to achieve a decisive first place competition. Aside from just securing a win in this contest and the other one that 
was held in this semester, these contests allowed for me to display my problem-solving ability as I was given a free sandbox of to experiment with 
innovative solutions.
